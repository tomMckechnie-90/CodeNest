# CODENEST

![CODENEST LOGO](/Documentation/Text-Logo.PNG)

Welcome to CODENEST ‚Äì a dynamic platform tailored for the software development community. This forum is designed to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and engage in meaningful discussions around all things software development.

What Is CODENEST

The forum provides a space where developers of all skill levels can connect, seek advice, share insights, and grow together. It includes features such as user authentication, discussion threads and like/dislike for a streamlined and intuitive user experience.

Why I Built It

I wanted to create a space where developers can easily connect, share their knowledge, and help each other out. Building this forum was a chance for me to put my coding skills to the test and learn more about what it takes to make something useful and user-friendly.

## Design


### Colour Scheme

![CODENEST Colour Scheme](/Documentation/Colour%20scheme.jpg)

The reason I chose this colour schem is it has high contrast for readability.
The black and white provide excellent contrast, ensuring that text or interactive elements are easily readable.
The addition of Seasalt softens the harshness of pure white, giving a balanced and approachable feel to the design.


### Typography

I imported the following monospaced fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

Courier Prime (Heading Font) - Ideal for headings due to its bold and impactful style that draws attention.

Fira Code (Sub Heading Font) - Slightly rounded shapes give it a friendly and approachable appearance.

Source Code Pro (Paragraph Font) - A professional and clean look, especially suitable for development-related content.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

## Features

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

* HTML
* CSS
* PYTHON

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

* Django
* Bootstrap v5
* GitHub
* Balsamic

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here]()

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. 

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
